##### By: Elliott Bolzan (eab91), Jay Doherty, Dennis Ling, Alex Zapata.

**Start**: Thursday, February 16.

**Finish**: Friday, March 10.

**Total Hours**:

- Elliott Bolzan: 70 hours.

### Team Roles
##### Front-End

- Elliott Bolzan: main responsibilities included the building of the shell, the script view, the workspace browser, the workspaces, and the view layout. In addition, I rewrote the parser in the back-end to use a `Tree` structure between both sprints, which satisfied two of the back-end challenging extensions. 
- Jay Doherty: Main responsibilities were handling the turtle display and animation for the front end, including providing the turtle interface to the back-end. Also helped implement the side panels for images, colors, and turtle information. Also assisted with turtle and display-related commands in the back-end.

### Program Files
* `Main.java`: contains main() and is used to start the program.
* `resources/images`: contains turtle images.
* `resources/languages`: contains language files specifying all of the Slogo commands.
* `resources/style.css`: contains the CSS code used to style our program.
* `resources/UserInterface.properties`: contains resources for user-facing text.
* `resources/WorkspaceSettings.properties`: defines a workspace's initial configuration settings.
* `data/examples`: contains scripts that can be used to test the program.

### Impressions


* Elliott Bolzan: this project was a stimulating challenge. Its modularity helped me better understand how to divide up the user interface - both visually and in terms of code. I also found the process of implementing the parser using recursion to be an interesting challenge. Overall, I preferred this project to CellSociety and Breakout: it felt like we were tasked with creating a complete, usable program, while the previous projects felt more gimmicky.
